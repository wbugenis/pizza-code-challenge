# Rails Assessment
It's time to put our Rails know-how to use.

## Objectives
+ MVC
+ REST
+ Request/Response Cycle
+ Form/Form Helpers
+ ActiveRecord
+ Validations
+ Stay calm, code and debug

## Setup

Before you begin, fork and clone this repo. Then run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed` to get started.

## The Domain
You've just been hired by the 'NYC Pizza Society' - congratulations! The devoted members want you to develop a web application that will allow them to record their favorite spots and eats. To do this, we need a way to keep track of the many NYC pizza restaurants and create custom pizzas for each location.

Luckily, another developer has already started the job using Rails. We have controllers, models and views to support the creation, listing and displaying of restaurants. Visiting `/restaurants` displays all of the restaurants recorded by members.

Unfortunately, we don't have a way for members to create their favorite pizzas (so, so sad) for each restaurant. **Each Restaurant can have several Pizzas on its menu and each Pizza belongs to the Restaurant**.

## Instructions / Deliverables

***To help you complete this assignment we listed the high level steps required to complete this assignment. Read through them carefully to get a sense of the requirements for this code challenge, and then tackle them one by one.***

1. Create the associations between the models. You may have to alter the current schema to get your code working.

2. On the restaurants index page, a restaurant's name should link to the restaurant's show page.

3. The restaurant show page should include the restaurant's name (eg. PizzArte), its address, and a list of the pizzas it sells. The pizza should link to that pizza's show page.

4. The pizza show page should display its name and ingredients.

5. As a visitor to the website, I should be able to create a new pizza with its name, ingredients, and add it to an existing restaurant.  

6. I should not be able to create a pizza with the same name as a pizza that already exists.

7. On the restaurant index page, I should be able to see a search bar, and use it to search for a restaurant.
